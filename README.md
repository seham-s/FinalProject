# FinalProject
the project uses the New York Times (NYT) Top Stories API to fetch and display the latest articles from a specific section of the NYT website: https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/top-stories-product/1/routes/%7Bsection%7D.json/get
The code demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by defining a NYTAPI class, and it interacts with the NYT API to retrieve and print news articles as requested
I have added details comments to the python code created so the user can understand each part of the code
